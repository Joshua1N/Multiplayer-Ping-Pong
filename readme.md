# Multiplayer Ping Pong

## How to play:

### A player can either start by playing by hosting a server or connecting to an existing one. Once a player reaches 5 points the game will end.

## Commands:

### - host : Host a new game of ping pong
### - connect : Connect to an existing game of ping pong
### - help : Shows a list of commands

## How it works:

### When a player runs the host command 'host', a server is created using the IP and Port of where the file is running. To connect to another players server, you must enter their IP and Port. The game will begin right after the second player has joined the server.
